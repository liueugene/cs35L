1) Yes, the network is still secure because the data has been encrypted. Both the public and private
keys are needed to decrypt the communication between the client and the server, so anyone just observing
the bytes would not find any readable data.

Even if the other team logged all of our keystrokes, they still would not have the keys stored on the
client and server so the network would still be secure. Each pair of keys is generated uniquely by the system,
so if someone were to try and create more pairs by copying our commands, the keys would not match
and they would not be allowed to authenticate. However, while the network is secure, any messages
typed out on either machine would be revealed in plaintext by the keylogger, so the data itself is not secure.

If the other teams gained access to our USB drives, then it would no longer be secure. They could
copy the public and private keys from the drives or install malware that would send the keys to them
across the network. Once they obtain the actual keys, they can authenticate themselves using our
identities and decrypt our communications.


2) The verification process only makes sure that the file is the original copy from the sender and has
not been tampered with. However, it does nothing to prove the identity of the person signing it. A user
can type in any name and email address when they first generate the key pair, so it allows them to
impersonate someone else's signature.

To fix this problem, there would need to be a trustworthy third party known as a certificate authority
that could verify a signer's identity and document their public key. The third party would then issue
a certificate to match the signer's key. This way, someone could look at the certificate and trust that
the signature is from a legitimate source.
