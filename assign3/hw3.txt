Q1) case_long_iso_time_style is a label that is referenced by the goto further
    down in the switch statement. Since the patch removed the goto, there was
    no need to keep that label. It was not necessary to remove the line, but
    then it would become a useless label taking up space.

Q2) The original code searches for the date format used in the current locale,
    and if nothing is found, it falls back on the ISO ordering. The patched
    version removes the fallback so that the original Unix format is used.
    This could cause confusion in countries that use a different format,
    and break applications that expect a certain format in each locale when
    trying to read the output of ls.

Q3) The script prints a list index out of range error because /dev/null is
    a blank file. When line 275 in random.py tries to access an element
    in the empty list of lines, it raises an error.

Q4) It notes a syntax error on line 65 because Python 3 removes tuple
    parameter unpacking from the language. errno and strerror must now be
    unpacked and assigned on separate lines.
