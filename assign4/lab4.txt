8) Launch Emacs, press C-h k C-x v = for help on vc-diff
   C-h k C-x v u for help on vc-revert

9) C-x d ~/CS35L/assign4/diffutils
   press C-x v = to compare between v3.0 and current patched source
   switch to *vc-diff* buffer and press C-h m for function details

   Ran C-x v u on any files that are not src/*.c files first
   C-c C-a on the *vc-diff* buffer allows undoing hunks that have already
   been applied, run on all changes not including string constants

10) Copied the rejected lines and replaced the lines found using the
    search tool C-s

11) git clean -f
    Deletes all the untracked files
    
    cmp.c, diff.c, diff3.c, dir.c, sdiff.c, util.c are the only files now
    showing up as modified by git status

12) git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt
    Outputs the patch file

13) ./bootstrap
    ./configure
    make
    make check
    Builds everything in diffutils, make check results in errors
    
    src/diff . -
    outputs: src/diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory
    diff . - and diff --help show regular quotes instead of backticks

14) git branch -m diffutils-3.0-patch
        Renames the current branch to diffutils-3.0-patch
    git commit "quote patch" :wq
        Commits the patched files
        
    git checkout v3.0
        Goes back to the original 3.0 commit
        
    cp -r src ~/CS35L/assign4/diffutils-3.0
        Copies the 3.0 source to diffutils-3.0
    
    git checkout diffutils-3.0-patch
        Switches to the patched branch
    
    cp -r src ~/CS35L/assign4/diffutils-3.0-patch
        Copies the patched source to diffutils-3.0-patch
        
    cd ~/CS35L/assign4
    diffutils/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch
    > quote-3.0-test.txt
        Runs diff on the two source versions and outputs the results to
        the test file
    

15) cd ~/CS35L/assign4
    diff -pu quote-3.0-test.txt diffutils/quote-3.0-patch.txt
    > testpatchdiff.txt
    The files are not identical but the differences are innocuous. The actual
    source code changes between the two are identical, but some parts are
    listed in a different order, and the directory names are different because
    the files were copied into other locations in the previous step.
